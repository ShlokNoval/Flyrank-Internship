# FlyRank ML Internship — Starter Repo

**Applied Search Intelligence: Google Search Ranking & Discoverability**

This is the starting point for the FlyRank ML Internship. You **clone it**, build your work in
**your own public repo**, and share that repo URL with Assignment 1 — it's your workspace, your
submission, and your portfolio all at once. Everything you build stays there; we review it all
in one pass at the end of the track.

Everything here runs on a small **anonymized** slice of real FlyRank search data. No credentials,
no private client data, no setup headaches.

> **New here?** Read **[GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md)** first — every file explained, what to edit vs.
> leave alone, and where your own work goes. Five minutes.

## Quickstart — first win in 2 minutes

The fastest path is Google Colab (one click, zero install). Open Notebook 1 and run all cells:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/flyrank-bih/flyrank-ml-internship-starter/blob/main/notebooks/01_first_look_and_discovery.ipynb)
 **Week 1 — Run it, then discover a real truth yourself**

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/flyrank-bih/flyrank-ml-internship-starter/blob/main/notebooks/02_your_first_readable_model.ipynb)
 **Week 2 — The model is just a rule you can read**

### Prefer local?

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd flyrank-ml-internship-starter
pip install -r requirements.txt          # or: uv pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/run_all.py
```

That runs the whole pipeline on the bundled sample and writes results to `outputs/`.

## What you get

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `notebooks/` | Week 1–2 **first-win notebooks** (Colab-ready). Start here. |
| `scripts/01–05` + `run_all.py` | The runnable reference pipeline: prepare → baseline → train → evaluate → PDF. |
| `data/raw/content_refresh_anonymized.csv` | The anonymized starter dataset (~30k pages). |
| `outputs/` | Example outputs so you can see the **target shape** (`model_report.md`, `refresh_queue_sample.csv`, `charts/`). |
| `work/` | **Your space.** Lane experiments and your capstone live here — see `work/README.md`. |
| `docs/` | The core docs + the data dictionary (see below). |

### Read these (in `docs/`)

1. **`ml-core-foundation-framework.md`** — the first-principles map of ML as a whole system. The backbone of the live sessions.
2. **`ml-intern-dataset-and-lane-guide.md`** — how to use the data safely, the capstone workflow, and the analysis "lanes" you can pick from.
3. **`intern-free-tooling-guide.md`** — the zero-budget tool stack (Python, Colab, free AI assistants). You never need to pay for anything.
4. **`data-dictionary.md`** — all 44 columns: meaning, scale, and gotchas. Keep it open while you work.

## The pipeline (what `run_all.py` does)

```text
01_prepare_features.py   clean + build the feature vector, define the label
02_baseline_score.py     a transparent hand-rule "fix this first" score
03_train_model.py        logistic regression, decision tree, random forest (client-holdout split)
04_evaluate_and_export.py  ranked queue + charts + Markdown report
05_build_pdf_report.py   a shareable PDF summary
```

On the bundled sample, the learned model clearly beats the hand-written rule at picking the right
pages to review first (**Precision@50 ≈ 0.24 → 0.74**). The notebooks compute these numbers live, so
they always reflect the current data.

**Teaching point:** the model is the capstone, but the *workflow* is the lesson —
`problem framing → data cleaning → baseline → first model → evaluation → explainable recommendation`.

## Data safety (read `DATA_USE.md`)

- Only the small **anonymized** CSV ships here — no client names, domains, URLs, titles, or keywords.
- **Never** add raw private client data to this repo or your fork. Need more data? Request an approved
  release from your mentor — never export it yourself.
- Don't paste client data into third-party AI tools.
- Frame every result as **observed / measured / directional / decision-support** — never
  "I predicted Google's algorithm."

The `.gitignore` blocks datasets by default, and grading checks that no dataset was committed.

## Assignments & schedule

Weekly assignments, live events, and the capstone rubric live on the **InternHQ board** (your mentor
will point you there). This repo is the shared technical foundation they all build on.
